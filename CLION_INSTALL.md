# CLion Tutorial

CLion is a C++ IDE from JetBrains. If you have used other JetBrains IDEs such as PyCharm (for Python) or IntelliJ (for Java/Kotlin), or even Android Studio, CLion will be very familiar. 

CLion is cross-platform and will run on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Also, you can obtain an education license which lets you use CLion for free. You do need to sign up for a JetBrains account and get verified with your WSU email. The license lasts for a year, and as long as you are a student you can renew it.

## Installing CLion

To install, go to https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/. Next to the `Download` button, there is a link for [students and teachers](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) Scroll down a bit and there is a button to `Apply Now`

## Create Your First C++ Project

After you have CLion installed and running, you will see the welcome screen.

Click `New Project` and you will see the next screen.

 Make sure you have `C++ Executable` selected on the left. Put where you want the project saved in the `Location` text box. The last directory will also be the name of the project, so I'd name it something like `Project1`. For language standard, I wouldn't go higher than C++20. If for some reason you don't have C++20, select whatever the next highest version is, probably C++17. Lastly there is a checkbox for `Add onboarding tips`. I would unselect it, if you keep it checked it will generate comments in the code that help you get started with CLion, so if you want them you can keep it and just delete the comments later. If you decide to check the box and click `Create`, your project will open with a "Hello, world" program.

 For this screenshot, I selected `Add onboarding tips`. If you deselected that, yours will look different.
